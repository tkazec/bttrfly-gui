  "readme": "voice.js \n========\n\n## What is it?\nIt's the Google Voice library for [node.js](http://nodejs.org/).\n\nIt builds on and improves [node-google-voice](https://github.com/amper5and/node-google-voice), the original node.js Google Voice library.\n\nIt currently allows you to:\n\n* place calls\n* send texts\n* access and manipulate GV conversations\n* access and manipulate GV forwarding phones\n* access and manipulate GV settings\n* access and manipulate GV contacts\n* access and manipulate GV call groups\n* access and manipulate GV greetings\n* access and manipulate GV webcall widgets\n\n\n## Installation\nInstall via [npm](https://npmjs.org/package/voice.js):\n\n\tnpm install voice.js\n\nThe version on npm may not reflect all the latest changes, especially during times of heavy development. To get the most up-to-date version, download [the current master zip file](https://github.com/amper5and/voice.js/zipball/master), then run the following code from inside the folder:\n\n\tnpm install\n\n\n## Dependencies\n\n* [node.js](http://nodejs.org) \n* [googleclientlogin](https://github.com/Ajnasz/GoogleClientLogin)\n* [xml2js](https://github.com/Leonidas-from-XIV/node-xml2js)\n* [request](https://github.com/mikeal/request)\n\n[npm](https://github.com/isaacs/npm) should take care of dependencies, but in case it fails to do so, try installing these modules (and *their* dependencies) independently.\n\n\n## API\nThe API documentation is in `docs/API.md`. Also, see the examples for clarifications. \n\n\n## License\nMIT License. See LICENSE.\n\n\n## Conclusion\nGoogle does not have an official Google Voice API. Therefore, the nature of the requests and returned data can change without notice. It is unlikely to change often or soon, but I will make all efforts to keep up with the most current implementation. If you have any issues, please give me a shout, and I'll do my best to address them.",
